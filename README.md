Most tutorials on Python coroutines start with a running average.  This example is almost as simple,
but demonstrates Bayes' rule as applied to messages that may or may not be spam.

Bayesian spam filters are now pretty common, since an email client can get the user to run
supervised learning on emails, by asking the user to classify emails as spam. Those not marked
are classified as not spam.

So a brief example of statistical inference, Python coroutines, and machine learning, in a small package.
